A simple gem to implement active states on links using the standard Rails `link_to` helper. 
This can be helpful in navigation lists or buttons to give them a class when the current URL matches a condition on the link helper.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'link_to_active_state'

Or install from the repository:

    gem 'link_to_active_state', git: 'git://github.com/robotmay/link_to_active_state.git', tag: 'v0.1.2'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install link_to_active_state

## Usage

This gem adds a small bit of extra functionality to the default Rails `link_to` view helper. It provides a very simple way of adding classes to links based on the current path.

### Examples

Test the path using a string/path helper:
```ruby
link_to "Account", account_path, active_on: account_path
```

Which, if the `request.fullpath` matches `account_path`, will result in:
```html
<a href="/account" class="active">Account</a>
```

Using a regular expression:
```ruby
link_to "Account", account_path, active_on: /\/account/i
```

Or a proc:
```ruby
link_to "Account", account_path, active_on: lambda { request.fullpath == account_path }
```

### Custom options

By default the class "active" will be added to the existing classes of the link. However you can specify your own:

```ruby
link_to "Account", account_path, active_on: /\/account/i, active_state: "highlighted"
```

```html
<a href="/account" class="highlighted">Account</a>
```

You can also customise other options by using a proc:
```ruby
link_to "Account", account_path, active_on: /\/account/i, active_state: lambda { |html_options|
  html_options.merge({ "data-active" => "true" })
}
```

```html
<a href="/account" data-active="true">Account</a>
```

### Wrappers

If you need an active class on an li tag, for use in a Bootstrap nav for example:
```ruby
link_to "Account", account_path, active_on: account_path, active_wrapper: :li
```

Which will result in:
```html
<li class="active">
  <a href="/account" class="active">Account</a>
</li>
```

Note the li tag is included as part of the html generated by the link_to helper and should not be added separately.
